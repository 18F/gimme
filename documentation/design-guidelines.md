## Colors

## Typography

**Barlow** is the main typeface for the Rapid Request App. The typeface was chosen for its precise, standardized letterforms, tall-x height, and legibility at smaller sizes. It  closely resembles DIN the typeface used on marines.com  

**Roboto** is used as a secondary typeface. It is used for interactive elements such as buttons, badges, and links. The use of the secondary typeface further differentiates the interactive elements from the non-interactive content.


## Margins and Spacing

### Layout Grid
The RRA is laid out on an 8 column grid. Margins and gutters are 24dp across all media sizes, and elements grow and shrink accordingly.

### Horizontal Space
As a rule of thumb, the minimum space between interactive elements is at least 28dp. This is a larger distance than the minimum recommended by Google Material Guidelines, in order to accommodate users who may be wearing gloves while using the RRA.

### Vertical Space
In general, there should be 32dp of vertical space between major sections, and 24dp of vertical space. Within a component, the amount of space between elements may be smaller (8dp â€“ 16dp).
